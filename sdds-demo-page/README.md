- Updated example using the ngx-sharebuttons component.
  The share buttons can be viewed at the bottom of the start page, right before the footer.

- Demo page built on angular and using SDDS components, with very little or no modifications.

- Uses angular routing for routing
- Uses ngrx for app state management.
- Not entirely built for mobile, might be updated with the design in the future.

1. Use a recent version of node (I use 16)
2. npm install
3. npm run start

based on this design:
